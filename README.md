# Hello-world
First git

Howdy,

My name is Ben, or MrFrames, as you like. I've been coding for around 4 months, and so far I've covered python + django, html5, css, and the beginings of java. I like working with and solving problems with algorithms. Looking to develope skills as a backend web developer & help make the community more awesome as I go.

My early projects on here won't be particularly ambitious, but I'll be looking to develop them over time as my knoledge grows.

I don't quite have a feel for the community here yet, so I'll leave it at that.

Current snippets:

<ol>
  <li> Abs-date range - Functions for manipulating dates, getting days sinc millenium & days between dates.
  <li> Reorder headers - Functions to help map one list of headers into another using difference scores & user shuffling, goal is to return a dict which can be used to reorder data into a new table if the headers are written differently, or have a different number of columns.
<ol>
