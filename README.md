# Hello-world
First git

Howdy,

My name is Ben, or MrFrames, as you like. I've been coding for around 4 months, and so far I've covered python + django, html5, css, and the beginings of java. I like working with and solving problems with algorithms. Looking to develope skills as a backend web developer & help make the community more awesome as I go.

My early projects on here won't be particularly ambitious, but I'll be looking to develop them over time as my knoledge grows.

I don't quite have a feel for the community here yet, so I'll leave it at that.
